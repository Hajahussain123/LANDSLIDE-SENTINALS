ABSTRACT

Landslides are among the most devastating natural hazards, causing loss of life, 

infrastructure damage, and environmental degradation. The increasing frequency and 

intensity of landslides, often linked to climate change and human activities, highlight the 

urgent need for effective monitoring and early warning systems. Landslide Sentinels 

represent an advanced integration of geospatial technologies, real-time data acquisition, 

and machine learning for proactive landslide risk management. These systems utilize 

satellite-based remote sensing (e.g., Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2), in-situ monitoring (e.g., 

GPS, inclinometers), and hydrological data to track predisposing factors such as soil 

moisture, rainfall intensity, and land deformation. Through predictive analytics and 

dynamic risk assessment models, Landslide Sentinels enable the identification of 

vulnerable zones, provide real-time alerts, and support disaster preparedness efforts. By 

enhancing situational awareness and facilitating timely interventions, Landslide Sentinels 

play a critical role in mitigating the socio-economic impacts of landslides and advancing 

resilience in susceptible regions. The abstract outlines the principles, applications, and 

future potential of Landslide Sentinels as an innovative solution in disaster risk reduction.
